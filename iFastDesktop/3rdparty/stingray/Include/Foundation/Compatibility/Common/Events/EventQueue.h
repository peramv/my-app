//@class IEventQueue | Interface to an event queue. Events are placed in
// the queue using the <mf IEventQueue::QueueEvent> method. Each event is
// assigned a priority so that the event queue can dispatch events according
// to their priority. Events are dispatched to event routers using
// the <mf IEventQueue::DispatchEvent> method.
//
//@mfunc BOOL | IEventQueue | QueueEvent | Place an event in the queue and
// assign it a priority.
//@rdesc TRUE if the event is successfully added to the queue; otherwise FALSE.
//@parm IEvent* | pIEvent | Pointer to event object.
//@parm UINT | nPriority | Priority that the queue should assign to the event.
//
//@mfunc BOOL | IEventQueue | DispatchEvent | Remove next event from the queue
// and send it to an event router
//@rdesc TRUE if an event was dispatched; otherwise FALSE.
//@parm IEventRouter* | pIEventRouter | Pointer to event router to receive
// event.
//@comm The queue determines the next event to be dispatched and pulls it
// from the queue. It then sends it to the event router using the
// <mf IEventRouter::RouteEvent> method. The next event in the queue
// is usually determined by a combination of chronological order and
// priority. This function removes the event from the queue.
//
//@mfunc void | IEventQueue | ClearAllEvents | Remove all events from the
// queue without dispatching them
//@rdesc void
//@comm This function clears out the queue without dispatching any of
// the events.
