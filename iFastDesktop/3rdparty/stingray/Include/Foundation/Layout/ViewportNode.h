//@comm 
// There are two types of viewports in MVC: windowed viewports and windowless
// viewports. The former are implemented as real windows, so they can be attached
// to standard window layout nodes. Windowless viewports draw directly on the area 
// of their master window, they do not have a window of their own. This characteristic
// is very similar to the functionality <c CDCLayoutBase> offers in the context
// of the layout manager. CViewportNode specializes CDCLayoutBase by delegating the
// painting processes to the corresponding IVisual methods, and performing the appropiate
// steps in RealizeNode to assign the new area to the viewport.
