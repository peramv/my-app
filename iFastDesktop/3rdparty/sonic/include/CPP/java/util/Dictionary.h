   * The <code>Dictionary</code> class is the abstract parent of any 
   * class, such as <code>Hashtable</code>, which maps keys to values. 
   * Every key and every value is an object. In any one <tt>Dictionary</tt> 
   * object, every key is associated with at most one value. Given a 
   * <tt>Dictionary</tt> and a key, the associated element can be looked up. 
   * Any non-<code>null</code> object can be used as a key and as a value.
   * <p>
   * As a rule, the <code>equals</code> method should be used by 
   * implementations of this class to decide if two keys are the same.
