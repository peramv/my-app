  /**
   * This class implements a hashtable, which maps keys to values. Any
   * non-<code>null</code> object can be used as a key or as a value. <p>
   *
   * An instance of <code>Hashtable</code> has two parameters that affect its
   * performance: <i>initial capacity</i> and <i>load factor</i>.  The
   * <i>capacity</i> is the number of <i>buckets</i> in the hash table, and the
   * <i>initial capacity</i> is simply the capacity at the time the hash table
   * is created.  Note that the hash table is <i>open</i>: in the case a "hash
   * collision", a single bucket stores multiple entries, which must be searched
   * sequentially.  The <i>load factor</i> is a measure of how full the hash
   * table is allowed to get before its capacity is automatically increased.
   * When the number of entries in the hashtable exceeds the product of the load
   * factor and the current capacity, the capacity is increased by calling the
   * <code>rehash</code> method.<p>
   *
   * Generally, the default load factor (.75) offers a good tradeoff between
   * time and space costs.  Higher values decrease the space overhead but
   * increase the time cost to look up an entry (which is reflected in most
   * <tt>Hashtable</tt> operations, including <tt>get</tt> and <tt>put</tt>).<p>
   *
   * The initial capacity controls a tradeoff between wasted space and the
   * need for <code>rehash</code> operations, which are time-consuming.
   * No <code>rehash</code> operations will <i>ever</i> occur if the initial
   * capacity is greater than the maximum number of entries the
   * <tt>Hashtable</tt> will contain divided by its load factor.  However,
   * setting the initial capacity too high can waste space.<p>
   *
   * If many entries are to be made into a <code>Hashtable</code>,
   * creating it with a sufficiently large capacity may allow the
   * entries to be inserted more efficiently than letting it perform
   * automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table. <p>
   *
   * This example creates a hashtable of numbers. It uses the names of
   * the numbers as keys:
   * <p><blockquote><pre>
   *     HashtableRef numbers = createHashtable();
   *     numbers->put(createString("one"), createString("1"));
   *     numbers->put(createString("two"), createString("2"));
   *     numbers->put(createString("three"), createString("3"));
   * </pre></blockquote>
   * <p>
   * To retrieve a number, use the following code:
   * <p><blockquote><pre>
   *     StringRef n = StringRef::cast(numbers->get("two"));
   *     if (n != null) {
   *         System.out.println("two = " + n);
   *     }
   * </pre></blockquote>
   * <p>
