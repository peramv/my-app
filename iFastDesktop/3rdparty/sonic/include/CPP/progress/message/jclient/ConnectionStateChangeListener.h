/**
 * This class is implemented by developers who wish to be informed of changes in the
 * state of a connection.
 * <P>
 * connectionStateChanged must not call any JMS operations related to the connection other than
 * getConnectionState(), getBrokerURL(), getBrokerReconnectURLs() and getStandbyBrokerReconnectURLs().
 * <P>
 * It is recommended that you do not perform any time- or CPU-intensive processing in the
 * connectionStateChanged( ) method, as this may impede the client reconnect.
 * <P>
 * A fault-tolerant connection that fails and reconnects successfully will call its
 * ConnectionStateChangeListener with RECONNECTING state on the failure detection,
 * followed with ACTIVE state on successful reconnect.
 * <P>
 * A fault-tolerant connection that fails and fails to reconnect will call its
 * ConnectionStateChangeListener with RECONNECTING state on the initial failure detection,
 * followed with FAILED state when all reconnect attempts fail. Finally, if an ExceptionListener
 * is registered, ExceptionListener onException method is called
 * <P>
 * When a connection fails the ConnectionStateChangeListener connectionStateChanged method
 * is called before the ExceptionListener onException method.
